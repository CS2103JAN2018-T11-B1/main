== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *scheduling features
** What it does: allows the users to plan their activities by creating tasks, delete unnecessary tasks,
and browse through their schedule with ease using the find and sort utilities.
** Justification: Scheduling features such as task addition and deletion is clearly essential in the task management process.
Meanwhile, find and sort features are introduced as the amount of tasks is expected to grow significantly to the point where it is unreasonable to navigate through
the tasks one at a time.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
** Credits: _{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}_
